    <h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
    <p>In this project, I explored implementing a basic rasterizer with features such as drawing triangles,
      supersampling, transforms, and texture mapping with antialiasing. The rasterizer is able to take SVG files and
      display them.</p>

    <h2 align="middle">Section I: Rasterization</h2>

    <h3 align="middle">Part 1: Rasterizing single-color triangles</h3>
    <p>To rasterize triangles, I use the three line test to check whether every point in the bounding box is in the
      triangle. For every pair of vertices, I define the normal line between them and a function that determines whether
      the dot product between the normal line and the vector from the first vertex to the point is negative.
      If said dot product is negative or 0 (to handle edge cases), then the point is inside the triangle edge.
      If all three functions for each edge of triangle say that the point is inside the triangle, then I render that
      point as part of the triangle. However, my three line test only works on a counterclockwise winding of the
      vertices of the triangle because of the way I build the lines tests, so I first ensure that the vertices are
      specified in counter-clockwise winding by ensuring that the cross product between to edges of the triangle that
      share a vertex is positive. If the cross product is negative, then I call the function again but with the vertices
      specified in reverse order.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do this test for all points in the bounding box of the triangle, which I find by finding the min x and y and the
      max x and y, and render all points that pass the three point test. Since I only iterate through each pixel in the
      bounding box once, my algorithm is no worse than one that checks each sample within the bounding box of the
      triangle.

    <h3 align="middle">Part 2: Antialiasing triangles</h3>
    <p>Supersampling was implemented by scaling the internal sample buffer by the square root of the supersampling
      factor, k, and adjusting all functions accordingly. `fill_pixel` was modified to fill all k*k pixels in the scaled
      sample buffer that represent the individual frame buffer pixel with the same `Color`. Similarly,
      `rasterize_triangle` scaled its internal coordinate system by k and did the same three point test on all pixels of
      the scaled bounding box. However, `rasterize_triangle` now directly fills the sample buffer instead of using
      `fill_pixel` as an intermediary. Finally, when resolving the sample buffer to the frame buffer, the frame buffer
      renders the average color between all k*k Color objects in the sample buffer that represent the frame buffer
      pixel.
    </p>

    <p>
      With supersampling implemented, I could now antialias my rasterized triangles. Instead of sampling once for each
      frame buffer pixel, I could now sample k squared times per pixel and average the color, smoothing the color
      transition between pixels and reducing jaggies in the rasterized triangle. Furthermore, by increasing the sampling
      rate of the image, we can approach and bypass the Nyquist frequency and ensure that there is no aliasing effects
      in the final image. We can see the antialiasing effect below.

    <h3 align="middle">Part 3: Transforms</h3>
    <p>I implemented transforms using transforms matrices in homogeneous coordinates. Below is the running robot I made
      by first rotating its entire body slightly and then by rotating and translating each individual arm and leg to
      match running posture.</p>

    <h3 align="middle">Part 4: Barycentric coordinates</h3>
    <p>Barycentric coordinates allows one to specify a 2D point as a weighted average of the three vertices of a
      triangle and generalizes to higher dimensions. There are many different interpretations of barycentric coordinates
      in 2 dimensions. The one I used was the notion that the barycentric coordinates represent the proportional
      distance the point is from each vertex when comparing altitudes. However, they can also be viewed as the
      proportional areas of the triangles formed from the point and the two opposing vertices or as a 3D basis transform
      in linear algebra.
    </p>

    <p>
      What makes barycentric coordinates useful are the proportional distance and area interpretations, as they allow
      easy interpolation within triangles. For example, below is a triangle where the color of the three vertices are
      red, green, and blue and all other colors are interpolated. Every color for every point in the triangle is based
      on the proportional distance to each of the three vertices and is calculated by converting the point into its
      barycentric coordinates and computing a weighted average of the colors using the barycentric coordinates as
      weights.

    <h3 align="middle">Part 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping</h3>
    <p>Pixel sampling is the process of determining the value of a pixel through measurements. In the case of texture
      mapping, pixel sampling is achieved by transforming the screen coordinates into the coordinate system of the
      texture map and then sampling the color from the texture map.
    </p>
    <p>I achieved this for texture mapped triangles, when given the texture map coordinates for vertex of the triangle,
      by using barycentric coordinates to transform the screen coordinates for any point within the triangle to the
      texture map coordinates with interpolation. Once I had the texture map coordinates, I would then sample the
      correct color with either nearest sampling or bilinear sampling. Nearest sampling simply takes the color of the
      nearest texture map pixel as the color while bilinear sampling takes the weighted average of the colors of the the
      four nearest pixels based on the proximity to the specified texture map coordinates. Below showcases the
      differences between nearest and bilinear sampling.</p>

    <div align="middle">

      </table>
    </div>
    <p>
      We can see a relatively large difference between nearest and bilinear sampling when supersampling at rate 1:
      nearest sampling has significant aliasing at supersampling rate 1 (jaggies on the word Berkeley) while bilinear
      sampling does not. However, this difference is not as significant when supersampling at rate 16 because a high
      supersampling rate already antialiases, reducing any extra antialiasing effect bilinear sampling has on the
      texture map.
    </p>
    <h3 align="middle">Part 6: "Level sampling" with mipmaps for texture mapping</h3>
    <p>
      Level sampling is sampling textures at different texture map resolutions that helps prevent aliasing at both high
      and low frequencies depending on the footprint each screen pixel has on the texture map. I implemented this by
      using mipmaps that store the texture map at different resolutions after low-pass filtering and downsampling. When
      sampling from the texture maps, I would first use barycentric coordinates as above to calculate the texture map
      coordinates of nearby screen pixels (plus or minus one pixel in the x or y coordinate) and find the longest length
      between the original texture map coordinates and the nearby texture map coordinates, L, after scaling by the
      length and width of the full resolution texture map. L is an estimate of the footprint the screen pixel has and I
      would use log2(L) as the mipmap level to sample from. When the level sampling is L_NEAREST, I used the nearest
      level to log2(L), when the level sampling is L_LINEAR, I would proportionally weight the adjacent levels by how
      close they were to log2(L), and when the level sampling is L_ZERO, I would use the full resolution texture map.
    </p>

    <p>Pixel sampling, level sampling, and supersampling are all methods of sampling that I implemented in this
      project and have their own tradeoffs.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Pixel sampling the simplest form of sampling that requires the least memory and computation. One either
        samples the nearest pixel (P_NEAREST) or the four nearest pixels (P_BILINEAR) and averages them. While this
        makes pixel sampling fast, it also makes pixel sampling have low antialiasing power and, especially nearest
        pixel sampling, susceptible to aliasing and jaggies.</li>
      <li>The simplest solution to the aliasing is to increase the sampling rate through supersampling, but
        supersampling is very computationally and memory intensive. If the sampling rate is k, then supersampling uses k
        times more operations and memory. As a result, supersampling trades speed for extremely powerful antialising
        power. </li>
      <li>Finally, level sampling provides a good tradeoff between pixel sampling and supersampling. I compute mipmap
        levels at exponentially decreasing resolutions, so I only use 1/3 more memory than pixel sampling and still
        get good antialiasing power through the precomputed, downsampled and antialiased mipmaps. Furthermore, the
        additional computation reasonable as I only need to sample two nearby pixels to determine the mipmap level to
        use, making level sampling fast. However, the antialiasing effect of mipmaps cause overblur at long distances.
      </li>
    </ul>
